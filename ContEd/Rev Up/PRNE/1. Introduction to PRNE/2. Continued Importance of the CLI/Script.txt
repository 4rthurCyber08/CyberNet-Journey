 Continued Importance of the CLI

Network engineers sometimes ask "Am I going to become a software developer?" and "What will happen to all my CLI knowledge?" The answers are simple: No, the CLI is not going away, and you will still need your CLI knowledge. As you progress on your programmability journey, you are not replacing one skill with another, but adding to your skill set to become a more capable engineer.

There will always be a need for your CLI knowledge, such as the following:

    An alternative way to interact with network devices

    Advanced troubleshooting

    Working with older devices

    Working with a tool that has not been updated to use a deviceâ€™s API
