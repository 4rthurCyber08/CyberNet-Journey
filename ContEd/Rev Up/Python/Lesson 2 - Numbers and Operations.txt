Numbers and Operations

Linux/UNIX
Installing Python
	Useally Python is already installed

Type python -V in the terminal
	py 3.x.x you have py3
	py 2.x.x try python3 -V

If no py3, install it with the package manager

Windows/Mac OSX
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest py3
Install it
	*Note on windows make sure to select Add Python to PATH

Interactive Interpreter
Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
test small pieces of code or functions

Two prompts: >>> and ...
... -more code is needed

Integers: 1,2,3
Floating point numbers: 2.0, 3.14
Booleans: True and False
Comments: everything that follows a #
Operators: +, *, /, **, ==, >
Exceptions: SyntaxError

Operators

	unary: only one operand
	- prefix: operator before operand
	- postfix: operand before operator
	binary: two operands
	- infix: operator between operands

	Mathematical: +, -< *, /, // (Floor Division = gives you integer instead of full decimal), %(calculate remainder), **
	Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
	Identity: is, is not
		is
			obj1 is obj2	
				True if obj1 and obj2 refer to the same object, False otherwise
				
	Containment: in, not in
		in
			elem in seq
				True if elem is an element of the sequence, False otherwise
	
	Bitwise: &, |, ~, ^, <<, >>
		Bitwise AND	&
		Bitwise OR	|
		Bitwise Not	~
		Bitwise XOR	^
		Left Shift	<<
		Right Shift	>>
		
	Boolean: and, or, not
		not x
			True if the operator is false
			
	Assignment: =, +=, -+, ...
		
	Highest Precedence
		**
		+X, -X
		*, /, //, %
		+, -
		==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, in, not in, is, is not
		not x
		and
		or
	Lowest Precedence
	
	Change Precedence ()
	
	Boolean: True, False, None
	 Short Circuit Evaluation
	 
	 Truthness
		true values		false values
		True			False, None
		"non-zero"		"zero"
		-10, 0.001		0, 0.0
		non-empty		empty sequences	
		'hello', (3,5)	'', (), [], {}
		[1, 2, 3]
