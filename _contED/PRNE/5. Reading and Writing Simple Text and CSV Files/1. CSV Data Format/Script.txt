 CSV Data Format

A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a simple text file that contains data in a tabular format. While this format is very common, there has never been any formal documentation. This lack of consistency causes different vendors to implement CSV in different ways. The different implementations cause subtle differences in how the data is produced in different applications. The data can be separated by commas, semicolons, tabs, and can be surrounded by double quotes. These differences make reading CSV files from different sources challenging.

These are examples of some of the differences:

    aaa,bbb,ccc

    "aaa","bbb","ccc"

    aaa;bbb;ccc

    aaa bbb ccc

CSV files are often used for exchanging data between different applicationsâ€”for example, a database that lists devices with their management IP, username, and password is read by an application that is configuring those devices.

The example is a CSV file (devices.csv) with switch hostnames, vendors, models, and locations. There is also a header line and each field is separated by a comma.
