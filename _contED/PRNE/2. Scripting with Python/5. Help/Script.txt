 Help

There are two functions that can be used to find which methods are available for a data type. The first function is the dir() function; this is a built-in function that returns a list of attributes along with any available methods, the method description, and syntax. The second function is the help() function. The help() function displays documentation of data types, functions, classes, and so on. There are two ways you can use the help() function. The first way is to pass the function an argument, as shown.

- 01

The second way is not to pass help() an argument. When this happens, Pythonâ€™s help utility starts. Once the help utility starts, you can then enter the topic you want information for. An example is shown below where the help utility was started.

>>> help()

To exit the help utility, enter Q and press the enter key.
