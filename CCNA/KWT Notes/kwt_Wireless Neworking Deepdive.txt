Access Point - a device that will allow a wireless device to connect to a wired network.

Wireless LAN Design Considerations
	Wireless Deployment Options
		Autonomous Access Point: configured one-by-one
			-Standalone, independent device
			-Home or small office environments
			-Controller-less deployment model
			-Not commonly used in large enterprise networks
	
		Lightweight Access Points: Lightweight as in you don't have to do a lot of configurations because multiple of Lightweight AP can be configured simultaniously via Wireless LAN Controller
			-Requires central wireless LAN controller
			-Controller-based deployment model
			-WLCs can be physical or virtual
			-Controller communicates changes to the APs
			-Control and provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) //an old ver Lightwight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP)
	
			[WLC]
			/ | \ :CAPWAP Tunnels
		 AP1 AP2 AP3
		
		Deployment
			Cisco FlexConnect 
				-Configure and control remote wireless network
				-Similar to Layer 3 roaming with CAPWAP
				
				Central Switched //have both data and traffic be sent through CAPWAP tunnels all the way back to WLC
				-Normal CAPWAP mode of operation
				-Typically not recommended
				
				Local Switch //keep local data, local. Config for only control traffic.
				-Map user traffic to VLAN on adjacent switch
				-Control and management traffic still sent over CAPWAP to WLC

Location Services
	Use cases for location services:
		-Enterprise asset tracking //make inventory jobs easier and more
		-Location-Based advertising //send advertisement because of location detected
			
			Recieved Signal Strength (RSS) //Access points can locate a device regardless of association.
			
	Cisco Solutions:
		-Real-time location services (RTLS)
		-Cisco DNA Spaces //see devices superimposed on a floor plan on a building
		-Cisco Meraki

Wireless Topology
	Ad Hoc Wireless LAN - have one wireless device talk directly to another wireless device without infratstructure.

Radio Frequency Range:
	-Between 3kHz and 300GHz
	-Wireless communication found with this range
	-2.4GHz band = 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz
	-5 GHz band = 5.15 - 5.85 GHz
	-Wireless bands subdivided into channels
	
	Non-Overlapping 2.4GHz Channels
		-Center Frequency //just because you chose the next channel doesn't mean you don't recieve frequency from the prev or the next.
			5MHz Between Channels
			Exception: 12 MHz between channel 13&14
			Channel 14 only allowed in Japan for 802.11b
		
		How to get non-overlapping channels in 2.4GHz range? 
		*Have 5 channels of Separation
		
	2.4GHz Channels - NON-OVERLAPPING

	What channels to use if you have to use more than three APs?

	RF Signal Strength:
		-measured in decibel milliwatts (dBm)
		-transmitters range between 1 and 100 milliwatts (mW)
		-milliwatt (mW) = 1/1000 of a watt
	
	mW to dBm Relationship
		1mW = 0dBm
		10mW = 10dBm
		100mW = 20dBm
		1W = 1000mW = 30dBm
		
		Rule of 10s and 3s:
		*Gain of 10dBM = mW power is multiplied by 10
		*Loss of 10dBM = mW power is divided by 10
		*Gain of 3dBM = mW power is doubled
		*Loss of 3dBM = mW power is halved
		
		Recieved Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)

	Signal to Noise Ration (SNR)
		Difference in decibels between signal and background noise
	
		Signal to Noise Ratio = 25dBm = (Signal-NoiseFloor)
		Signal = -65
		Noise Floor = -90
	
Access Point Modes
	-Autonomous Access Point
	//if set up identically. Doesn't scale well
	-Lightweight Accesspoint

LAP Special Purpose Modes
	Local Mode
		-Default operating mode of LAPs
		-Provides SSID and wireless network access
		-When not actively in use, LAP will preform background operations //ex. search for rogue APs
	
	Monitor Mode
		-LAP only performs background operations //prevent rogue APs, scan location services, etc,.
		-no network access provided to users
		-monitoring of IDS events, rogue APs, location-based services, etc.

	FlexConnect Mode
		-allows for management of LAPs at a remote location
		-Controlled over a WAN location
	
	Sniffer Mode
		-LAP acts as a packet capture device
		-Dedicated to receiving wireless traffic
		-traffic forwarded to a traffic analyzer system for analysis
	
	Rogue Detector Mode:
		-LAP is dedicated to discover rogue access point
	
	Bridge Mode
		-LAP  is used to bridge together separate sites as a mesh network
		-point-to-point
		-point-to-multipoint
	
	Flex+Bridge Mode
		-Flex + Bridge
	
	SE-Connect Mode
		-LAP operates as a spectrum analyzer device
		-Gathers information about all channels
		-Forwards information to a spectrum analysis tool
		-Cisco Spectrum Expert
