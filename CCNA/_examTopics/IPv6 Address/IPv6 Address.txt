IPv6 address

Network Interface(64bits)	|	Interface ID(64bits)
	2400 : 5400 : 0A20 : 0800 	: 	0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e
		//unlike IPv4 there's no subnet mask in IPv6

	the first 3 bits is the ADDRESS PROFILE.
		2 400 : 5400 : 0A20 : 0800 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e
	[#001# 0] 400 : 5400 : 0A20 : 0800 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e
	
	//when the ADDRESS PROFILE starts with a 2 or a 3, it is a sign that it's a global unicast address.

	the next 45 bits is the GLOBAL ROUTING PREFIX. This is assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
	[001 #0] 400 : 5400 : 0A20# : 0800 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e
	//also referred to as SITE PREFIX
	
	the next 16 bits is the #SUBNET ID#. This is for subnetting.
	2400 : 5400 : 0A20 : #0800# : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e
	
	the next 64 bits is the #INTERFACE ID#
	2400 : 5400 : 0A20 : 0800 : #0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 200e#
	//Can be manually assigned, randomly generated (autoconfig), or generated using the MAC Address (EUI-64).

Unicast - destined to a single device : one to one
	Global Unicast (2000::/3 - 3fff::/3) - is the range of public IP addresses of IPv6. It is globally routable 

	Link-Local (FE80::/10) : is automatically assigned to all interface. Every node in the network is assigned one regardless if it has IPv6 address.
	Not globally routable. (Local Network only)
		//used for services such as neighbor discovery.
		
	Unique Local (FC00::/7 & FD00::/8) - is the range of private IP addresses of IPv6. Not globally routable.
		//FC00::7 is a local address but IANA (Internet Assigned Number Authority) has reserved this IPv6 address. 
		As a result, all unique local address use FD00::/8.
		Not globally routable.

		Special Address
		Unspecified address (::) - it's the default route of IPv6
		Loopback (::1/128) - it's the loopback of IPv4
		
		Compatibility Address - used to migrate IPv4 address to IPv6
		The process done simply by mapping the values and converting to hexadecimals. 
			ex. 192.128.20.142 to IPv6
				//Let w.x.y.z be the IPv4 address
			
				0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : w.x : y.z
				0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 192.128 : 20.142
				0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : [1100 0000] . [1000 0000] : [0001 0100] . [1000 1110]
				0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : [C0] . [80] : [14] . [8E]
				
				0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : C080 : 148E

				Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
				 -configured using neighbor discovery
				 -no DHCP server required

					6to4
						Required: Interface must have IPv6 and IPv4 address
						IPv4 address is encapsulated in IPv6 address
						//allowing IPv6 packets to be routed over IPv4 networks
						
						All address that use 6to4 starts with 2002.
							ex. 2002:w.x.y.z:Subnet ID:Interface ID:
					
					ISATAP (Intra Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol)
						Required: Interface must have IPv6 and IPv4 address
						IPv4 address is encapsulated in IPv6 address
						
						All address that use ISATAP starts with an INTERFACE ID of 0:5efe
							ex. 2001 : 04fe : 248a : 15c5 : 0 : 5efe : w.x.y.z :
				
					TEREDO
						Allows IPv6 clients to work with IPv4 NAT
						
						Address starts with 2001:0000
							IP address contains:
							
							Prefix, Teredo IPv4 server, Flags, UDP Port, and Client Public IPv4 
							2001 : 0000 : w.x.y.z : ???? : ???? : w.x.y.z
				
Multicast - Sends data to multiple nodes
	Multicast address - for all nodes (FF02::1) //well-known
		Predefined Multicast group - all routers (ff02::2)
		Always starts with :FF??:
	Transient
		ff10::/12
	Solicited-Node
		ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00::/104

Anycast - unicast address that has been made into anycast.
	Indistinguishable from other Unicast addresses.
	Data will go to the closest node
		//Reduce Dynamic Denial of Service (DDOS)
	
	Nodes advertised through routing protocols.
