Copper Cables
	Electromagnetic Interference (EMI or Crosstalk) - when radio waves are picked up by or radiated by a cable carrying another signal resulting in signal degradation.
		//happens when one transmission gets carried over to another transmission because the Electromagnetic field of both cables were induced on each other.
	
		Coaxial Cables - the inner wire is surrounded by insulation(copper mesh) to prevent EMI.		
			Measured by Impedance - a circuit's opposition to traffic flow (measured in Ohms[Ω]).
			75Ω
				RG-59
				RG-6 - less loss with longer distance compared to RG-59
			50Ω
				RG-58 - thin Ethernet(thinNet) networks: 10BASE2. 10mbps
				RG-8/U - thickNet networks: 10BASE5.
	
			*Twinaxial 
				-has 2 inner conductors
				-commonly used in data centers
				-40Gbps or 100Gbps
				-7 meters

				Using both standards on both ends of a twisted pair will achieve the same result, and is considered to ba a Straight (patch) cable.
					Straight (Patch) Cable - allows signal to pass through from end to end.
						-used to connect disimilar devices together.
				
				Using two different standards on both ends of a twisted pair is considered to be a crossover cable.
					Crossover Cable - are used to connect 2 similar devices together. //ex two computers, two switches, etc,.
					
					//Both Straight and Crossover are both the most common types of twisted pair cables that are used in a LAN.

		Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) - twisting pairs of wires provide EMI protection.
		
			//In environments with a lot of interference or a need for higher speed, a Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) is preffered.
		Shielded Twisted Pair - used for industrial purposes
			-some use foil.
			-others use braiding like coaxial cables.
				
		Plenum-Rated Twisted Cabling - cables that will not excude toxic fumes in extreme heat.
			//when regular insulation is exposed to extreme heat, it can start to release toxic fumes.
			Thus the need for Plenum-Rated cables.

Fiber Optic Cable
	Modes of Propagation - light bouncing through the Fiber Optic Cable at different angles resulting in different speeds.
		Multimode Delay Distortion - when there's multiple modes of propagation and causes data to arrive in the wrong order.
			Multimode Fiber - Fiber optic with a wider core.
	
		//one of the solutions for Multimode delay distortion is having a narrower core, which will only allow a single mode of propagationg.
			Single Mode Fiber - Fiber Optic cable that has a narrow core.
	
	Fiber Connecters
		Straight Tip (ST)
		Lucent, Local, Little(Name may vary) Connector(LC)
		Subscriber, Standard, Square(Name may vary) Connector(SC)
		Media Ternmination Recommended Jack or Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack(MTRJ) - contains both Fiber Optic Strands
		
			Attatching Connectors together
			Ultra Physical Contact (UPC) - May cause damage because of reflection
			Angled Physical Contact (APC) - One end of the connector is cut at an 8 degree angle causing the reflection to be dissipated in the cladding of the fiber.
