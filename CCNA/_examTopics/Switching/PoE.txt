Data Link Layer:
	Logical Link Control (LLC) establishes paths for data on the ethernet to transmit between devices.
	Media Access Control (MAC) uses the hardware address of a device Network Interface Card (NIC) to identify devices to show the source and data transmissions.

Ethernet transmits data packets using an algorithm called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

Power Management Modes
 - Auto: The switch automatically detects if the connected device requires power.
  If granting power would exceed the system power budget, the switch denies power, ensures that power to the port is turned off, generates a syslog message, and updates the LEDs. 
  
 - Static: The switch pre-allocates power to the port (even when no powered device is connected) and guarantees that power will be available for the port. 
   
 - Never: The switch disables powered-device detection and never powers the PoE port even if an unpowered device is connected.
