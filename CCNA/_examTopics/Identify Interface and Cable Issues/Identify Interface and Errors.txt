Identify interface and cable issues.

Collisions occurs when two devices sends packets at the same time and on she shared network segment.
The packets collide and both devices must send packets again, which reduces network efficiency.
	//Packets collide because two hosts sends it out at the same time.
	//resulting in hosts needing to resend the packets reducing network efficiency.

	Troubleshoot using the 'show interface' command //another command is 'show interface status'

		Router1# show interface fa0/0

			Hardware is Lance, address is 0002.16c4.5301 (bia 0002.16c4.5301) //MAC Address
			
			//Cable Satus
			Line status				Protocol Status		Interface Status	Typical Root Cause
			Administratively Down	Down				Disabled			The shutdown command is configured on the interface
				-
			Down					Down				NotConnect			No Cable; bad cable; wrong cable pinouts; speed mismatch; neighboring device is powered off, shutdown, or error disabled.
				-
			Up						Down				NotConnect			Not expected on LAN switch physical interfaces
				-
			Down					Down (err-disabled)	err-disabled		Port security has disabled the interface.
				-
			Up						Up					Connected			Interface is working.

	Errors	
		*I* Input errors - this counter will increase when the interface recieves a frame with any kind of error.
			//counts all errors based on incoming frames.
		
		*O* Output errors - similar to input error, but instead of recieving frames, it counts errors from sent packets.
			//counts all errors based on packets sent.
			
			Runts - are ethernet frames that are less than 64 bytes.
			//receiving frames that is smaller than expected
			
			Giants - frames that exceed the IEEE 802.3 frame size and have an incorrect FCS
			//receiving frames that is bigger than expected
			
			Throttles - when the interface fails to buffer the incoming packet.
		
			CRC - recieved packet does not match with the expected checksum. Probably issue caused in transit.
			
Mismatch Duplex
	Duplex -  can recieve and transmit data at the same time.
	Half-Duplex - can only recieve OR transmit data.
	
	Duplex mismatch error
	##
		03:17:25: %CDP-4-DUPLEX_MISMATCH: duplex mismatch
		discovered on FastEthernet0/23 (not half duplex). with R1
	##
	//configure duplex using the 'duplex {auto | half | full}' command
	
		mismatch on Full duplex side: High FCS Errors
	
		mismatch on half duplex side: High collisions, specifically late collisions
		
		//the result of mismatch duplex are network slowdowns.

Mismatch Speed
	If you've got a speed mismatch, it will typically bring the interface down.
		//results 'sh int status' Down-Down-NotConnect
