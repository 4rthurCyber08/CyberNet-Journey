Triple A Security Framework

1. Authentication - to verify the user trying to access the network. //Multifactor Auth, Biometric Auth
	//Who are you?
	
2. Authorization - ensures authenticated users are given the appropriate privileges and access to resources. //Network Policies, Access control policies, permissions
	//What can you do?
	
3. Accounting - documenting what an authenticated user does in a network.  Resource used. //Resource used, login and logout time, data sent and recieved, etc,.
	//What did you do?

Uses a Client-Server Model

AAA Security Framework:

RADIUS - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
	Network Access Server (NAS) - to communicate with acentral server to authenticate dial-in users.
		-The connecting point of the user and AAA servers.
		-Can be a remote access server for remote users.
		-Uses a client server model
		-Industry standard
		-uses UDP port (1812 and 1813)
		
	Comprised of:
		A protocol with a frame format that utilizes User Datagram Protocol
		A server
		A client
	
			PC A - (Internet) - [NAS] - [Radius Server: User Database & Accounting Database]
		
			Supplicant : a user accessing a RADIUS server
			WAP : Radius client
		
		User & Pass -> Authentication Request -> Compares with user database -> authentication acknowledgement -> records is accounting database -> approval to user

	RADIUS encrypts only the password in the access-request packet, from the client to the server. The remainder of the packet is unencrypted. 
	Other information, such as username, authorized services, and accounting, can be captured by a third party.

	RADIUS combines authentication and authorization. The access-accept packets sent by the RADIUS server to the client contain authorization information. 
	This makes it difficult to decouple authentication and authorization.
	
	Industry standard.
	
TACACS+ - Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
	-Uses TCP port 49
	-Cisco Proprietary
	
	TACACS+ uses the AAA architecture, which separates AAA. This allows separate authentication solutions that can still use TACACS+ for authorization and accounting. 

	TACACS+ encrypts the entire body of the packet but leaves a standard TACACS+ header. 
	Within the header is a field that indicates whether the body is encrypted or not.
		//However, during normal operation, the body of the packet is fully encrypted for more secure communications.
