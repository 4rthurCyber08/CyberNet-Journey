File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

Industry standard protocol to transfer files over a network
Both use a client-server model
 -Clients can use FTP or TFTP to copy files from a server
 -Clients can usr FTP or TFTP to copy files to a server

	//Upgrading operating system


FTP - send and recieve files. TCP port 21. Passes files in plain text.
		//nmap -p [port] 21 [port 21]
		//website - index of [index.html]
		
		control connection -handles all ftp commands //get input
			port:source [21] port:destination
		
		data connection - upon starting transfering files	
			ACTIVE - server initiating the session
				port:source [20] port:destination
				//can get blocked by firewall
			PASSIVE - client initiating the session
				port and destination is randomly generated
				//because it is initiated by the client, the firewall will allow the traffic
		
		Disadvatages
			-sent in clear text (login credentials, inportant info, etc,.) //good for hackers :3

	FTPS - FTP Secure or FTP Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) is an extension of FTP that supports the use of Transport Layer Security(TLS) and SSL encryption. //better security
	*Transport Layer Security  is a cryptographic protocol that replaces SSL, Secure Sockets Layer Protocol.
	-Tunneled
	
		

TFTP - stripped back version of FTP. Very simple way to transfer files quickly and efficiently.
		//why use tftp? - not on the internet. Use it locally such as producing backup of files.
			//ex. 	copy running-config tftp //save switch, router, cucm config to your drive c
					host ip
