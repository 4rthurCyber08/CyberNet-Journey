LAB 5 - LACP Config Sim

// - annotations

Tasks
Physical connectivity is implemented between the two Layer 2 switches, 
and the network connectivity between them must be configured.

1. Configure an LACP EtherChannel and number it as 44; configure it between switches SW1
and SW2 using interfaces Ethernet0/0 and Ethernet0/1 on both sides. 
The LACP mode must match on both ends.
2. Configure the EtherChannel as a trunk link.
3. Configure the trunk link with 802.1q tags.

@SW1,SW2
conf t
int range e0/0-1				//use 'range' to configure the interface of both e0/0 and e0/1
 channel-group 44 mode active	//channel-group 44(//assign #) mode(choose LACP modes: on, passive, or active)
 no shut
 exit

int Port-channel 44				//interface of the created channel group 44. Use Port-channel for accessing the interface
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q	//change to Qpid -(isa sa mga apat na superhero)- 802.1q
 switchport mode trunk
 exit


4. Configure VLAN ‘MONITORING’ as the untagged VLAN of the EtherChannel.

@SW1, SW2
conf t
do sh vlan
 int Port-channel 44
 switchport trunk native vlan 746	//change the native vlan to vlan 746 for etherchannel 44
 //verify
 sh int trunk
 sh vtp status
