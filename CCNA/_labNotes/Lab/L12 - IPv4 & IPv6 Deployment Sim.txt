R1 has been pre-configured with all the necessary commands. All physical cabling is in place
and verified. Connectivity from PC1, PC3, and the Server must be established to the switches,
and each port must only allow one VLAN.
1. Configure the VLAN connecting to the switch port for PC3 with the name “SALES”
2. Configure the switch port connecting to Server1
3. Configure the switch port connecting to PC3
4. Ensure R1 discovers SW-1 via the Cisco proprietary neighbor discovery protocol and all other
devices on the network are unable to discover SW-1
