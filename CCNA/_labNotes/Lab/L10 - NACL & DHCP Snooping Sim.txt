LAB 10 - Named Access-List & DHCP Snooping Sim

// - annotations

Tasks

Refer to the topology. All physical cabling is in place. Configure local users accounts, modify the
Named ACL (NACL), and configure DHCP Snooping. The current contents of the NACL must
remain intact.

Task 1
Configure a local account on Gw1 with telnet access only on virtual ports 0-4. Use the following
information:
	Username: wheel
	Password: lock3path
	Algorithm type: Scrypt
	Privilege level: Exec mode
	
	@GW1
	conf t
	sh run
	username wheel privilege 15 argorithm-type scrypt secret lock3path	//algorith-type scrypt - algorithm for password encryption. Password will not be available when scrypt is set, which means secret must and should be used instead.
	:or:
	username wheel privilege 15 secret 9 lock3path //secret 9 means use scrypt algrorithm while secret 5 uses md5 algorithm 
	line vty 0 4
	 transport input telnet	//only allow telnet on this device
	 login local //will require a username and password upon accessing the device. if user and pass are not set you're locked out. While <login> will only require password, no username needed.
	 exit
	
Task 2

Configure and apply a NACL on Gw1 to control network traffic from VLAN 10:
	Name: CORP_ACL
	Allow BOOTP and HTTPS
	Restrict all other traffic and log the ingress interface, source MAC address, the packetâ€™s
	source and destination IP addresses, and ports.
	
	@GW1
	conf t
	 ip access-list extended CORP_ACL
	  permit udp any any eq 67
	  permit udp any any eq 68
	  permit tcp 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
	  deny ip 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 any log-input
	  exit
	 int e0/0
	  ip access-group CORP_ACL in

Task 3

Configure Sw1:
	Enable DHCP Snooping for VLAN 10
	Disable DHCP Option-82 data insertion
	Enable DHCP Snooping MAC address verification
	Enable trusted interfaces.
	
	@sw1
	conf t
	 ip dhcp snooping //enable snooping feature.
	 ip dhcp snooping vlan 10 //dhcp snooping keep an eye on vlan 10. enable snooping for vlan 10 only
	 no ip dhcp snooping information option //turn off option-82 data insertion
	 ip dhcp snooping verify mac-address //verify mac-add
	 int e0/1
	  ip dhcp snooping trust //become trusted
	  exit
	 int e0/2
	  ipd dhcp snooping trust //become trusted
	  exit
