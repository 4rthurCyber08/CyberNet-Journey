Nodes - devices that forms a network network (router, switches, firewall, server, client, etc,.)
	Clients - a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
	Server - a device that provides functions and services for clients.

	Switches
	-have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to.
	-provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN.
	-do not provide connectivity between LANs/over ther internet.
		//ex. Catalyst 9200 & Catalyst 3650 - Cisco's enterprise grade switches
	
	Routers
	-have fewer network interfaces than switches.
	-used to provide connectivity between LANS
	-user to send data over the internet
		//ex. ISR 1000, ISR 900, & ISR 4000
	
	Firewalls (Network)
	-monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
	-can be placed inside the network, or outside the network.
	-next-gen firewalls when they include modern and advanced capabilities.
	
	//ex. ASA(Adaptive Security Applicance) 5500-X & Firepower 2100
	
		Host-based firewalls
		-software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.

Networking Protocol
	Protocol - a set of logical rules defining how network devices and software should work
		Open System Interconnection Model
		
		7. Application Layer - interacts with software applications. NOT Applications
			ex. HTTP & HTTPS are Layer 7 protocols (https://www.cisco.com)
		
			-Identifying communication partners
			-Synchronizing Communication
				*Encapsulation - *DeEncapsulation
		
		6. Presentation Layer - Data in the application layer is in application format
			-needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network
			-encryption of data as it is sent and decryption of data as it is recieved.
			ex. .exe .jpg .yml .xml
		
		5. Session Layer - Controls dialogues (sessions) between communication hosts.
			
		4. Transport Layer - segments and reassembles data for communication between end hosts.
			Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur.
			Provide host-to-host communication.
		
			|
			v
			Data + L4 Header : called a segment //a segment of the data with a L4 header each.
		
		3. Network Layer - provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks.
			 Provides logical addressing IP addresses.
			 Provides path selection between source and destination.
			 
			 Routers operate at Layer 3
		
			|
			v
			Data + L4 Header + L3 Header : packet //adds source and destination IP address
		
		2. Data Link Layer - Provides note-to-node connectivity and data transfer. ex PC to switch to router etc,.
			Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium. ex. copper UTP cables.
			Uses layer 2 addressing (MAC Address)
		
			|
			v
			L2 Trailer + Data + L4 Header + L3 Header + L2 Header : Frame //
		
		1. Physical Layer - physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices.
			Voltage, maximum transmission distances, etc,.
			
			
			//Data, Segment, Packet, Frame, Bit - Protocol Data Units.

IPv4 Header
	4 4 6 2 16 16 3 13 8 8   32
	Version : 4 bits
		Identifies the version of IP used
		IPv4 = 4 (0100)
		IPv6 = 6 (0110)
	
	Internet Header Length (IHL) Length : 4 bits
		Final field of the IPv4 header.
		specifies the length of the header in 4-byte increment.
			Min Value 5 = 5x4 20bytes
			Max value 15 = 15x4 60bytes
	
	Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) : 6 bits
		Used for QoS
		Used to prioritize delay-sensitive data (streaming voice, video, etc,.)
	
	Excplicit Congestion Notification : 2 bits
		Provides end-to-end notif for network congestion without dropping packets.
		Optional
		
	Total Length Field : 16 bits
		Indicates the total length of the packet 
		Measured in bytes
		Min value 20 bytes
		Max Value 65 535
	
	Identification field : 16 bits
		If a packet is fragmented due to being too large, this field is used to identify which packet the fragment belongs to.
		Packets are fragmented if larger than the MTU
		MTU is usually 15000 bytes
		Fragments are reassebled by the recieving host.
	
	Flags Field : 3 bits
	Used to control/identify fragments
		Bit 0: is reserved always set to 0
		Bit 1: don't fragment, used to indicate a packet that should  not be fragmented.
		Bit 2: More fragments, set to 1 if there are more fragments in the packet, set to 0 for the last fragment.
	
	Fragment offset field : 13 bits
		used to indicate the position of the fragment within the original, unfragmented IP packet.
		Allows fragmented packets to be reassemled even if the fragments arrive out of order.
	
	Time to live field : 8 bits
		used to prevent infinite loops.
		recommended value = 64
	
	Protocol Field : 8 bits
	
	Header Checksum
	
	Source & Destination : 32 bits each
		the IPv4 source and destination of the packet

VLANs

Access Ports - manage traffic for one VLAN
Trunk Ports - manage traffic to for one or more VLAN

	VLAN Tagging - switches will tag frames that they send over a trunk link, allowing the recieving switch to know which VLAN the frame belongs to.
		//Untagged Port = Access Port
		//Tagged Port = trunk port
		
			VLAN Tags
				ISL (Inter-Switch Link) and IEEE 802.1q/dot1q
				-ISL is an oldd Cisco Proprietary protocol created before IEEE 802.1Q
				-802.1Q industry standard.
				
				Eth Header | Packet | Eth Trailer
				
				Preamble|SFD|Destination|Source|	802.1Q	|Type
				
				802.1Q - 4 bytes
					Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)
					Tag Control Information (TCI)
					
					TPID (16bits) | TCI / PCP|DEI | VID
					
					TPID - 16 bits, 0x8100, indicates the frame is tagged with 802.1Q
					
					PCP (Priority Code-Point) - 3 bits, for class of Service
					
					DEI (Drop Eligible Indicator) - 1 bit length, indicate frames that can be dropped if network is congested.
					
					VID (VLAN ID) - 12 bits - Identifies the VLAN it belongs to.
						//2^12 = 4096 total VLANs range of 0-4095, 0 & 4095 are reserved.
						
					
					VLAN Ranges (1-4094) is divided into two sections
						Normal VLANs: 1-1005
						Extended VLANs: 1006-4094
				
				Native VLAN
					-ISL does not have this feature
					-Switches does not add an 802.1q tag to frames in the native VLAN
					-when a switch recieves an untagged frame on a trunk port, it assumes the frame belongs to the native VLAN
					*Preferrably Match native VLANs
			
			int g0/0.20
