QoS

Bandwidth - capacity of the link
Delay - how long it takes to go from host to destination or back. //one-way/two-way delay
Jitter - each packets arrive at diff times
Loss - loss of packets

Standards
Delay 150ms
Jitter 30ms
Loss 1%

Queuing
First in First Out - Best Effort
	-packets gets drop when the queue is full
		//termed tail drop - 
		TCP Global syncronization
		 -sliding window - rate in which traffic is sent

	*To prevent TCP Global Synch
		Random Early Detection (RED)
			Keep the rate of traffic even.
	
		Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)
			
QoS
Classification
	Classify which traffic recieves priority
	 -ACL
	 -NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) //Deep Packet Inspection
	 -Layer 2 & 3 Headers
	 
	 -PCP Priority Code Point - 802.1q
		IEEE 802.1p
			3 bits = 8 possible values
				0 best effort - regular traffic - no priority
				3 Critical App //IP Phone initial - but uses 5
				4 video 
				5 voice
	 -DSCP 
		Default Forwarding - best effort
		Expedited Forwarding - for voice - low loss, latency/jitter
		Class Forwarding
		Assure Forwarding - drop precedence
			000 00 0
			001 01 0 
			AF11
			
			=dscp 10
		
		Voice - EF
		Interac Vid - AF4X
		Stream - AF3X
		High Prior - AF2X
		Best Eff - DF
		
	Weighted Round-Robin
	Cyclically output data from each queue
	
	Class Based Weighted Fair Queueing  - well known scheduler
		LLQ (Low Latency Queing) - designates one or more queues as strict priority - the scheduler will always take the next packet from that queue until its empty.
			-best for voice/video to reduce delay/jitter
		
	Traffic Shaping and Policing
		Shaping buffers traffic in a queue
		Policing drops traffic if traffic rate goes over the configured rate
