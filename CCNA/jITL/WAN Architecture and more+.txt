Multi Protocol Label Switching
	Label - VPNs
	CE Router = Customer Edge Router
	PE Router = Provider Edge Router	//label on L2 header
	P Router = P Router
	
	Layer 3 MPLS VPN - CE & PE Routers peer using OSPF
	Layer 2 MPLS VPN - No Peering look like it's directy connected
	
	Fiber, wIRELESS 4G/5g, Serial, CATV (Cable TV)

Digital Subscriber Line - Provides internet connectivity via Phone Lines
	Modem
	
CableTV - Provides internet connectivity via Cable Lines
	Modem 

Redundant Internet Connections
	Single Homed = 1 Service Provider 1 connection
	Dual Homed = 1 service provider 2 connections
	Multihomed = 2 service provider 1 connection

Virtualization
	Server
		Apps
		OS
		Hardware Components
		
	Type 1 Hypervisor (VMware ESXi) - VMM(Virtual Machine Monitor) - metal
	Type 2 Hypervisor (VMware Workstation) Hosted Hypervisor -- runs as a program
		//Personal use
	
	VMWare - 
	partitioning - divide system resources
	Isolation - isolate through diff VM
	Encapsulation - save the entire state of a virtual machine to files. move and copy
	 Hardware Independence - migrate vitrual machine to any physical server
		
		Reduce Cost
		Less work to set up
		Downtime Reduced

Cloud
Traditional Data Center
	On-premises
	Colocation - Rent a space for your infrastructure

http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final
	Cloud Computing
		Five essential Characteristics
			On-Demand	self service - able to use the service freely
			Bread Network Access - can be accessed through diff mediums - responsive
			Resource Pooling - request are made through allocation from a shared pool of resources.
			Rapid Elasticity - expansion of necessary resources.
			Measured Service - metered use.
			
		Three Service Models
			SaaS - user uses application (Microsoft Office 365)
			PaaS - a platform to create apps - that still uses the cloud infrastructure of the provider (Google App Engine)
			IaaS - provision processing, storage, networks, and othe fundamental computing resources. Google Compute Engine 
			
			
		Four Deployment Models
			Private - exclusive use (business, large enterprises)
			Community - provisioned exclusive use by a community of consumers / organizations
			Public - 
			Hybrid - combination of other cloud models

Containers

Hypervisor type 1: native/Bare-metal on top of the hardware | type 2 : hosted - run on top of os an applications

Containers : container Engine
	Contianer Orchestrator - software to automate the deployment, management, scaling etc,. of container.
		//ex. Kubernetes, Docker Swarm

Wireless
Wireless Networks
CSMA/CA - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
Wireless Signal Coverage
	-Signal Absorption, wireless signal passes through a material turning to heat, weakening the original signal
			Reflection, when a signal bouncess off of a metal resulting in a weak signal.
			Refraction, when a wave is bent when entering a medium where the signal travels at a different speed.
			Diffraction, happens when a wave encounters an obstacle and travels around it.
			Scattering, happens when a material causes a signal to scatter in all directions

	Independent Service Set
		//connects client directly no ap needed
	Basic Service Set - is a kind of infrastructure Service Set
		//clients connect via AP
	Extended Service Set - a group of BSS
	Mesh Basic Service Set - used when it's difficult to run an ethernet connection to every AP
		Root access point- AP connected to the wired network
		Mesh AP

	AP Modes
		-Repeater Mode - repeates the signal - for extending the signal range
		-WorkGroup Bridge -  for clients tha do not support wireless
		-Outdoor Bridge - connect networks over long distances

Autonomous AP
	-self contained that don't rely on a WLC
	-Can be configured via CLI, telnet/SSH, or HTTP/HTTPS web gui

Lightweight AP
	-functions can be split with a WLC
	-centralize management using a WLC
	-authorization through digital certificate between AP & WLC
	
CAPWAP


Lightwieght AP Modes
(Default) Local - AP offers a BSS for clients to associate with.
FlexConnect - Local + allows the AP to locally switch traffic between the wired and wireless networks if the tunnels to the WLC go down.
Sniffer - does not offer BSS/ not gonna wifi. Dedicated to CAPTURE 802.11 frames and send them to a device running
Monitor - dedicated to receive 802.11 frames to detect rogue devices. Can send de-auth messages to disassociate the rogue device
Rogue Detector - correlates info from WLC to listen to ARP messages to identify messages from rogue APs
SE-Connect (Spectrum Expert Connect) -  RF spectrum analysis on all channels
Bridge/Mesh Mode - like outdoor bridge mode of AP
Flex + Bridge - allows AP forward traffic with bridge

***
Cloud-Based APs
	-Cisco Meraki
		//regular traffic is not sent to the cloud
		only management traffic is sent to the cloud

Deployment of WLC
	Unified - a hardware appliance in a central location of the network. - 6kAP support
	Cloud-Based - The WLC is a VM running on a server, usually in a private cloud in a data center. - 3k AP support
	Embedded - WLC integrated within a switch - 200AP
	Mobility express - WLC is integrated within an AP  - 100AP


***
Wireless Security
Authentication - verify identity of a user or devices
	Methods
		Open Auth - clients sends an auth request and the AP accepts it.
		Wired Equivalent Privacy - RC4 algo
		
		EAP Extensible Auth Protocol
			LEAP, EAP-FAST, PEAP, EAP-TLS
			
			802.1x limit access until they authenticate
				Supplicant - device
				Authenticator - device that provides access to the network
				Authentication Server - the device that receives client credentials and permits/denies access.
					RADIUS Server/ TACACS+
			
			Lightweight EAP
				-req username and password
				-mutual authentication
				<-> challenge phrase
			
			EAP-Fast
				PAC - Protected Access Credential
				TLS Tunnel
				Auth
			
			Protected EAP
				Uses Digital Cert
				
			EAP TLS
				Req a cert on the AS and on every single client
