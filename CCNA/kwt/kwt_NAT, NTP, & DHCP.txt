// - annotations

commands:
1. sh ip nat translations
2. sh ip nat statistics
3. sh ntp status

Network services are not limited to providing address and routing, it can also provide more services.
	//We don't build a network for the sake of building a network, we build a network to provide services to the enterprise.

	1. NTP (Network Time Protocol)
		- Client mode: 'ntp server /ip of server/'	sets a source of time as basis for time on this router
		- Server mode: 'ntp master /stratum value/'	sets the router as the main source of time for the network.
	
	2. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) - Dynamically assign IP service
		- Client
		- Relay
	3. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
	4. Syslog Features
		- facilities
		- levels
	5. Remote access using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)
	
	
NAT (Network Address Translation) //Translate private address(ex. 10.1.1.1) to a public routable address(ex. 192.0.2.100)
 //device outside of the network
 OUTSIDE Local	//outside the local address but is still limited localy
 OUTSIDE Global	(203.0.113.100)	
 
 //device inside of the network
 INSIDE Local	(10.1.1.1 & 10.1.1.2)		//not globally routable
 INSIDE Global	(192.0.2.101 & 192.0.2.102) //globally routable

PAT (Port Address Translation)
 //make a note of both IP address and (ephemeral) port number. Use port number to keep track of devices
 INSIDE (Source IP: 10.1.1.1:41025) -> OUTSIDE (Source IP: 192.0.2.100:42025) //port number usually don't change. Only changes if the number is already used.
 
 INSIDE Local	(10.1.1.1:41025 & 10.1.1.2:42050)	
 INSIDE Global	(192.0.2.101:42025 & 192.0.2.102:42050)

NTP (Network Time Protocol) //"The reason time exist is so because everything doesn't happen at once" 

//"A man with one watch always knows what time it is. A man with two watches isn't quite sure."
//We want our network to have 1 watch
Network devices need accurate time
	- to help network admins correctly interpret logs
	- to use digital certificates
Uses UDP Port 123
Uses a stratum number to measure believability of a time source
Int(Stratum 1) -> R1(Stratum 2) -> SW1 //Stratum = hops, 16 stratum is considered unbelievable

	//NTP = UDP Port 123

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP States
D-O-R-A
Discover 		//DISCOVER a DHCP Server by using broadcast "Are there any dhcp servers out there?"
Offer			//"Yes, I'm a dhcp server. I would like to OFFER my services."
Request			//"Ok, give me an IP Address." Make a REQUEST packet using 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 as a temporary source ip add.
Acknowledgement	//"Ok, here's your IP Address"

*Note Broadcast does not cross a router.

What happens to an end device separated by a router and it's supposed dhcp server?
The router can be turned into a DHCP Relay/IP Helper.
