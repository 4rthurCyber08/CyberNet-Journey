Qualiy of Service Deepdive

Why need QoS? Periodic Congestion

Not Strict - Best Effort
	FiFo - First in, First out. First come first serve traffic management.
	
Less Strict - DiffServ
	Bandwidth Guarantee for each application and share bandwidth with other apps depending on when they need it.
Strict - IntServ
	Bandwidth Guarantee for each app but does not share with other apps even if a certain app is not using bandwidth.
	

A. QoS Mechanisms
	1. Classification and Marking - categorize different kinds of traffic and then mark them with a tag that will help other devices make forwarding decisions based on their category.
	2. Queuing - buffer incoming traffic if the device can't attend to it yet because it's currently in the process of managing another data.
			Create Sub Queues for VoIP packets & Best Effort packet.
				//Cisco Recommend make no more than 11 sub queues
	
	3. Congestion Avoidance - Have Congestion Avoidance prevent the queue form filling to capacity.
		TCP window size grows - sliding windows
			//TCP Synchronization - results in inefficient use of bandwidth
	
	4. Policing and Shaping - limit the bandwidth consumption. 
		//Speed Limit on traffic.
		Policing - more strict
		Shaping - queue the extra traffic
		
	5. Link Efficiency - prevent big payload from delaying smaller packet.
		//only if your link is less than 768k
		
B. Class of Service
	IEEE 802.1q Frame
		Tag Control Information Bytes
		 -Priority Bits [3bits] - CoS Bits : 8 possible values - 6 or 7 are not allowed - *best to have a CoS value of 5
		 -CFI
		 -VLAN ID
	//CoS Marking is Layer 2, which means it can be removed upon encountering a router. Therefore,
		ToS Byte - A marking that will survive a router hop
			IP Precedence - 3 leftmost bit of the byte
			
			DSCP - Differentiating Services Code Point - uses the 6 left most bits of the CoS byte
				//Preferrably used - ITF chose 21 values out of 64 values
					Per Hop Behaviors of the 21 values
						Name PHB					Decimal		Binary
					1	Default						0			000000
					2	Expedited Forwarding (EF)	46			101110
					3	Class Selector 1 (CS1)		8			001000
					4	Class Selector 2 (CS2)		16			010000
					5	Class Selector 3 (CS3)		24			011000
					6	Class Selector 4 (CS4)		32			100000
					7	Class Selector 5 (CS5)		40			101000
					8	Class Selector 6 (CS6)		48			110000
					9	Class Selector 7 (CS7)		56			111000
					
					DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF) Values
					
						Low Drop Probability	Medium Drop Probability		High Drop Probability
			Class	1	AF11(10) 001 010		AF12(12) 001 100			AF13(14) 001 110
					2	AF21(18) 010 010		AF22(20) 010 100			AF23(22) 010 110
					3	AF31(26) 011 010		AF32(28) 011 100			AF33(30) 011 110
					4	AF41(34) 100 010		AF42(36) 100 100			AF43(38) 100 110
						
						Low Drop	-threshold for dropping packets
						Medium Drop
						High Drop
					
						Default - give to default traffic
						EF - for higher priority
						
				A device using IP Precedence interacting with data that uses DSCP will only look at the first 3 bits. 
				Conveniently DSCP to IP is backwards compatible.
	
C. Weighted Random Early Detection	
	Industry Protocol Random Early Detection (RED)
		Output Queues - Min - Max Threshold
		0% potential of discard
			Increases
			Once exceed maximum probability of discard, it becomes 100% probability of discard.
	
	Cisco Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)
		Sets different RED profiles for each category
		Drop Profile for AF13,23,33,43 = min 25%
		Drop Profile for AF12,22,32,42 = min 30%
		Drop Profile for AF11,21,31,41 = min 35%
		
		ToS Byte
			0000 00 0	0
					ECT	CE
					
					ECT = ECN-Capable Transport
					CE = Congestion Experience
						//reduce the size of the packet being sent when it's too much
				
D. Queuing
	Prioritizing Traffic Types
		Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CB-WFQ)
			- Divide Queues to sub queues
				Sub Q
					-Call signaling	>= 1 Mbps *during times of congestion, this subq will have AT LEAST 1 Mbps bandwidth. You can have more if you need it and there's more is available.
					-Network Control >= 1 Mbps //min Bandwwidth Guarantee
					-Critical Data >= 3 Mbps
					-Bulk Data >= 1 Mbps
					-class-default *catch all class - default
					
					Cisco Limits 11 Classes of Traffic
		Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) - adds a Priority Queue <= 3 Mbps *prioritized but can only have a max 3 Mbps
			//preferably for voice

E. Traffic Conditioners
	Shaping 
		-delays excess traffic rather than dropping it.
		-Used on slower speed interfaces.
		
		ex.	CIR = Bc/Tc
			CIR Commited Information Rate - Average speed over the period of a second
			Bc = Committed Burst - Number of bits (for shaping) or bytes for (for policing) that are deposited in the bucket during a timing interval
			Tc = Timing Interval - the interval at which tokens are deposited in the token bucket.
			
				Token Bucket - place where bits gets dumped.
		
	Policing 
		-drops the traffic if the traffic exceeds the max value.
		-used on higher speed interfaces.
