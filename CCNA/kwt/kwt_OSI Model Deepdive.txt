Open Source Interconnection (OSI) 7 Layer Model

	//How we refer to DATA
		PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
		 Layer 1 - Bits
		 Layer 2 - Frames
		 Layer 3 - Packets/Data Grams
		 Layer 4 - Segments
		 
7. Application - NOT the program - it's the underlying service that supports the application
	//POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SecureShell
	Application Services
	Service Advertisement
	
6. Presentation
	//.exe .jpg .gif .mp4 .mp3
	Data Formatting - ASCII
	Encryption - md5, Scrypt
	
5. Session - Responsible for Establishing, Maintaining, Tearing down a session.
	//Net use x: \\10.10.10.10 \IPC$
	Data Streams
		"Hack mo katabi mo" "Delete mo lahat ng files sa drive C niya."

4. Transport
	//TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
	TCP - Reliable, keeps an eye on each data to make sure it's safe.
			//Three-way-handshake - Synchronization (SYN), SYN Acknowledgement (ACK), ACK
	UDP - Unreliable, will process data fast without batting an eye. For voice and video. 
			//Gamers Love UDP because they hate Latency
	Windowing - how much data can I send at any one time before expecting an acknowledgement		
					//recieve one segment - ACK - then sends 2 segment - ACK - send 4, 16, 32, etc,.
	Buffering - Queue packets.
			Tail Drop - packet dropped because Queue is full
3. Network
	//Router, IPv4, IPv6
	Logical Addressing - Learn IP Addresses and Learn what Neworks live in different interface.
	Switching(Not CiscoSwitch) - Packet Switching the act of routing is considered packet switching
	Connection Services - Flow Control
2. Data Link
	//Ethernet Switches, specifically defined Layer 2 Switch.
	Sub Layer: 	MAC (Media Access Control)
					Physical Addressing of a Networking Device
					Logical Topology
					Method of Data Transmission - Carrier Sense(Listen to the wire before transmiting)
				
				LLC (Logical Link Control)
					Connection Services - Flow control, Error Notification Services
					Synchronization of transmission
						ex. Isochronous(Look at a common external device for clocking)
							Asynchronous(Use own internal clock) + Start&Stop bits
							Synchronous(Clocking is shared between sender and reciever over a separate channel)
1. Physical
	//ethernet cable, Fiber Optic, Network Interface Card
		Physical items that transmit Bits.
	How bits are presented
		//How we represent data on the wire. How data can be encoded.
		AMI(Alternate Mark Inversion) 
			//"it's best to have an average of 0 volts on the wire"
			Presence Of Voltage (PoV)
				when sending voltage to represent a binary 1, balance the voltage by alternating + and - volts.
	Wiring Standards
		RJ45 Jack - 8 position 8 conductor connector.
		 Color Coded Wires - (T568B Standard)
	
	Physical Topology
		Bus Topology // -p-d-p-d-p-  //Carrier Sense Multiple ACCESS with Collision Detection
		Ring Topology (Logically ) // O	//Media Access Unit (MAU)
			-Physically it's a star Topology
	Synchronization
	
	Bandwidth - Broadband - different frequencies used to have multiple conversation at the same time
				Baseband
	Multiplexing Strategy
