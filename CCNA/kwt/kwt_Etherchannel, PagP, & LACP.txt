LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)

Etherchannel - simultaniously create traffic between two links. //max 8 links
	- resulting in higher bandwidth
	- provides load-balancing
	- creates redundant links // backups
	
PAgP: Port Aggregation Protocol
	Modes:
		On - no negotiation or any protocol. Will simply turn on etherchannel
		
			On + On = enabled
			
		Desirable - will send PagP packets to its peer and expects to recieve PagP packets back.
		Auto - will wait for its peer to send PagP packets, and PagP packets ONLY.
		
			Desirable + Desirable = enabled
			Desirable + Auto = enabled
			Auto + Auto = disabled
	
LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol //can have additional 8 links to existing max links
	Modes:
		On - no negotiation or any protocol. Will simply turn on etherchannel
		
			On + On = enabled
			
		Active - will send LACP packets to its peer and expects to recieve LACP packets back.
		Passive - will wait for its peer to send LACP packets, and LACP packets ONLY.
		
			Active + Active = enabled
			Active + Passive = enabled
			Passive + Passive = disabled

Trunk - send traffic for multiple VLANS for a single connection.
	-Add four tag Bytes to each frame except the Native VLAN.
	-Native VLAN, the one VLAN on a Dot1q trunk that is untagged.
	
	Ethernet Frame
	
	[Preamble 7 bytes][Start-of-frame Delimiter 1 byte] [Destination Address 6 bytes][Source Address 6 bytes][Type 2 byte] [Data 46-1500 bytes] [FCS 4 bytes]
	
		Preamble & SoF Delimiter - announces the arrival of a Ethernet Frame
		Type - IPv4 or IPv6
		
		IEEE802.1q Frame
		
		[Source Add][Tag type 2 bytes] [Tag control Identifier 2 bytes][Type]
	
	Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
		Mode: Access, Trunk, Dynamic desirable & Dynamic auto
			Access - only an access port
			Trunk - only a trunk port
			dynamic desirable - Negotiations: sends DTP frames
			dynamic auto - Passively waits for the remote switch to initiate trunk negotiations.

VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol - a protocol that will send VTP advertisement accross multiple VTP configured switches.
		//tldr. configuring a vlan on one switch will affect others.

VTP Modes
 1. Server - create/delete/modify VLANs
		-configuration revision number //sets a priority on what it will listen to
 2. Client - cannot create/delete/modify VLANs
 3. Transparent - doesn't participate VTP but can still forward advert
 4. Primary Server - only available in VTP ver 3, the only switch that can create/delete/modify VLANs
 
 //prevent problems from adding new switch
	switch to transparent mode then change config rev #

vtp mode server 	//set vtp mode to server
vtp domain CCNA 	//change vtp domain name - needs to match with other wanted switches ine the network
