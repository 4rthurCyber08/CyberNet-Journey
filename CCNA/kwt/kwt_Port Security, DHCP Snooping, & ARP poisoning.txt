A. Switch Port Security

Avoid Mac Flooding Attack
 Hacker Spams MacAddress to your Switch MacAddTable
 
//Port Security wants the port to be an access port
	conf t
	 int fa 1/0/2
	  switchport mode access
	  switchport port-security //turn on port-security
	  switchport port-security maximum 2 //specify the number of mac-address can be learned on this port
	  switchport port-security mac-address sticky //dynamically learn the first 2(specified by the previous command) mac-address that was learned by this port
	  
	  		//copy running-conf start in order to save mac address sticky
	  switchport port-security violation
			//protect - allow permit mac-add while disallow non permitted mac-add
			//restrict - similar to protect, extra increment security-violation counter. will document violation
			//shutdown - port will shutdwon int
						//to turn on after violation shutdown enter: 
							//shutdown then no shutdown
	  exit
	 errdisable recover cause psecure-violation //specify what to do to come out of error disable state, shutdown from violation
	 errdisable recover interval 30 //seconds will recover from a error disable state caused by violation shutdown
	 sh errdisable recovery				
	 sh port-security
	 
	  exit

B. DHCP Snooping
	 
ip dhcp relay information trust-all
//
@SW1
conf t
 int range gi0/1-10
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security maximum 5
 switchport port-security violation protect //what to do after going above the max mac-address
 switchport port-security
 
@SW1
conf t
 int gi 0/1
  ip dhcp snooping trust //trust this port for dhcp offers
  exit
 ip dhcp snooping			//activate dhcp snooping
 ip dhcp snooping vlan 1	//enabled dhcp snooping on vlan 1, trust offers
 
 exit

C. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Poisoning 

conf t
 int gi 0/1
  ip arp inspection trust
  exit
 ip ar inspecition vlan 1
