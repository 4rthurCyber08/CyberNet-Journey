LAB 7 - Vlan and Trunking Config Sim

Tasks

Three switches must be configured for Layer 2 connectivity. The company requires only the
designated VLANs to be configured on their respective switches and permitted across any links
between switches for security purposes. Do not modify or delete VTP configurations.

The network needs two user-defined VLANs configured:
VLAN 110: MARKETING
VLAN 210: FINANCE
1. Configure the VLANs on the designated switches and assign them as access ports to the
interfaces connected to the PCs.
		//create designated vlans 
		@SW1
		conf t
		 vlan 210
		  name FINANCE
		  exit
		 int e0/1
		  switchport mode access
		  switchport access vlan 210
		  exit
		  
		@SW2
		conf t
		 vlan 110
		  name MARKETING
		  exit
		 vlan 210 //even though SW2 doesn't have a device that uses vlan 210, we still need to make it because we need to forward data from a PC in sw1 to a PC in sw3 that uses the same vlan.
		  name FINANCE
		  exit
		 int e0/1
		  switchport mode access
		  switchport access vlan 110
		  exit
		  
		@SW3
		conf t
		 vlan 110
		  name MARKETING
		  exit
		 vlan 210
		  name FINANCE
		  exit
		 int e0/1
		  switchport mode access
		  switchport access vlan 210
		 int e0/2
		  switchport mode access
		  switchport access vlan 110
		  exit
		
		//verify
		@SW1, SW2, & SW3
		sh vlan br
		 
2. Configure the e0/2 interfaces on Sw1 and Sw2 as 802.1q trunks with only the required
VLANs permitted.
		@SW1 & SW2
		conf t
		 int e0/2
		  switchport trunk encaps dotq1
		  switchport mode trunk
		  switchport trunk allowed vlan 210 //vlan 210 needs to travel through sw1,sw2, & sw3 in order to reach PC6
		  exit
		
		//verify
		@SW1 & SW2
		sh int trunk
		  
3. Configure the e0/3 interfaces on Sw2 and Sw3 as 802.1q trunks with only the required
VLANs permitted.
		@SW2 & SW3
		conf t
		 int e0/3
		  switchport trunk encaps dot1q
		  switchport mode trunk
		  switchport trunk allowed vlan 110,210
		  exit
		
		//verify
		@SW2 & SW3
		sh int trunk
		@pc5
		ping 10.10.3.2 //the PC on SW1 should be able to ping the PC on SW3 since they're on the same vlan and are trunk allowed
		@pc3
		ping 10.10.2.2 //ip add of PCs might be different
		//Should only PING other PCs on the same VLAN and no other PC.
