LAB 4 - OSPF Config Simulation

// - annotations

Tasks
IP connectivity between the three routers is configured. OSPF adjacencies must be established.

1. Configure R1 and R2 Router IDs using the interface IP addresses from the link that is shared between them.
		
		//use 'sh ip ospf' to obtain info such as router-id and process-id. Might be different in actual exam.
		
		@R1
		conf t
		 router ospf 1 //configure ospf 1 on this router
		 router-id 10.10.12.1 //change router id

		@R2
		conf t
		 router ospf 1
		 router-id 10.10.12.2

		@R1 & R2
		clear ip ospf process
			-Yes

		//verify
		@R1 & R2
		sh ip ospf database

2. Configure the R2 links with a max value facing R1 and R3. 
R2 must become the DR. R1 and R3 links facing R2 must remain with the default OSPF configuration for DR election. 
Verify the configuration after clearing the OSPF process.

		@R2
		conf t
		 int e0/0
		  ip ospf priority 255 //set router priority to the highest in order for R2 to become the DR
		  exit
		 int e0/2
		  ip ospf priority 255
		  exit
		 exit

		@R1, R2, & R3
		clear ip ospf process
			-Yes
		
		//verify
		@R1, R2, & R3
		sh ip ospf neighbor
		//note R3 might still be a DR but can be ignored because of the next tasks


3. Using a host wildcard mask, configure all three routers to advertise their respective Loopback1 networks.
		@R1
		conf t
		 router ospf 1
		  network 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 //R1 will advertise the network among ospf routers in the same area unless a Area Boundary Router is configured.

		@R2
		conf t
		 router ospf 1
		  network 192.168.2.2 0.0.0.0 area 0

		@R3
		conf t
		 router ospf 1
		  network 192.168.3.3 0.0.0.0 area 0

4. Configure the link between R1 and R3 to disable their ability to add other OSPF routers.
		@R1 & R3
		conf t
		 int e0/1
		  ip ospf network point-to-point
