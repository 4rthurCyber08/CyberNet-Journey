LAB 9 - Named Access-List & Port Security Sim

// - annotations

Tasks
Refer to the topology. All physical cabling is in place. Configure a local user account, a Named ACL (NACL), and security.

	Task 1. Configure a local account on Sw101 with telnet access only on virtual ports 0-4. 
	Use the following information:

		Username: support
		Password: max2learn
		Privilege level: Exec mode
		
		@Sw101
		conf t
		username support privilege 15 password max2learn
		line vty 0 4
		 transport input telnet
		 login local
		 exit
		
	Task 2. Configure and apply a single NACL on Sw101 using the following:
		Name: ENT_ACL
		 Restrict only PC2 on VLAN 200 from pinging PC1
		 Allow only PC2 on VLAN 200 to telnet to Sw101
		 Prevent all other devices from telnetting from VLAN 200
		 Allow all other network traffic from VLAN 200
		
		@Sw101
		conf t
		ip access-list extended ENT_ACL
		 deny icmp host 192.168.200.10 host 192.168.100.10
		 permit tcp host 192.168.200.10 host 192.168.100.1 eq 23
		 deny tco 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23
		 permit ip 192.168.200.0 0.0.0.255 any
		 exit
		int vlan 100
		 ip access-group ENT_ACL out //ACL applied outbound on a VLAN will identify traffic going to devices from that vlan
		 exit
		
	Task 3. Configure security on interface Ethernet 0/0 of Sw102:
		Set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses to four.
		Drop packets with unknown source addresses until the number of secure MAC addresses drops below the configured maximum value. No notification action is required.
		Allow secure MAC addresses to be learned dynamically.
		
		@Sw102
		conf t
		 int e0/0
		  switchport port-security maximum 4 //maximum number of learnable mac-address
		  switchport port-security violation protect //when a new mac-address is recieved despite reaching the maximum number of mac-address the packet will be dropped but not logged
		  switchport port-security mac-address sticky //remember assigned mac-addresses
		  switchport port-security
		  exit
