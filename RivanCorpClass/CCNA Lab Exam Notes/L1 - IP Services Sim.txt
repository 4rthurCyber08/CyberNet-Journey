Tasks

Connectivity between three routers has been established, and IP services must be configured in the order presented to complete the implementation. 
Tasks assigned include configuration of NAT, NTP, DHCP, and SSH services.

1.	All traffic sent from R3 to the R1 Loopback address must be configured for NAT on R2. All source addresses must be translated from R3 to the IP address of Ethernet0/0 on R2, while using only a standard access list named NAT. To verify, a ping must be successful to the R1 Loopback address sourced from R3. Do not use NVI NAT configuration.
		//turn R2 to an access-point for the traffic sent by all of R3's ports/loopback to R1

		@R2
		conf t
		 ip access-list standard NAT //create access-list named, NAT, to identify traffic from R3
		  permit 10.2.3.3
		  permit 192.168.3.1
		  permit 10.1.3.11
		  exit
	 
		//Since it's stated 'from R3 to R1', the port on R2 that connects to R3 is considered INSIDE, while the other port on R2 that is connected to R1 is considered OUTSIDE. 
		//We want to Identify traffic from INSIDE, then have NAT translate it to OUTSIDE
		 int e0/1
		  ip nat inside
		  exit
		 int e0/0
		  ip nat outside
		  exit
		 ip nat inside source list NAT int e0/0 overload 
		//identify the ip address that passess through INSIDE based on the list provided by the access-list, NAT, then translate those addresses OUTSIDE - then keep tabs on each info through OVERLOAD

		//verify
		@R3
		ping 192.168.1.1

2. Configure R1 as an NTP server and R2 as a client, not as a peer, using the IP address of the R1 Ethernet0/2 interface. Set the clock on the NTP server for midnight on January 1, 2019.

		Configure R1 as NTP Server:
		@R1
		conf t
		 ntp master 1 //sets R1 as the NTP Server
		 ntp source e0/2 //specifically sets e0/2 as the reference clock by other clients. May not work on Packet Tracer.
		exit

		@R1
		clock set 00:00:00 January 1 2019
		
		@R2
		conf t
		 ntp server 10.1.3.1 //Sets R2 as the NTP Client of R1

		//verify
		//Make sure to wait since it takes a while for NTP to take effect
		@R1 & R2
		show clock

3. Configure R1 as a DHCP server for the network 10.1.3.0/24 in a pool named NETPOOL. 
Using a single command, exclude addresses 1-10 from the range. 
Interface Ethernet0/2 on R3 must be issued the IP address of 10.1.3.11 via DHCP.

		@R1
		conf t
		 ip dhcp excluded-add 10.1.3.1 10.1.3.10
		 ip dhcp pool NETPOOL
		  network 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0
		  exit

		@R3
		conf t
		 int e0/2
		  ip add dhcp
		  exit
		 do sh ip int br

4. Configure SSH connectivity from R1 to R3, while excluding access via other remote connection protocols. 
Access for user netadmin and password N3t4ccess must be set on router R3 using RSA and 1024 bits. 
Verify connectivity using an SSH session from router R1 using a destination address of 10.1.3.11. 
Do NOT modify console access or line numbers to accomplish this task.

		@R3
		conf t
		 line vty 0 4
		  transport input ssh //tell vty line to use ssh instead of telnet
		  login local
		  exit
		username netadmin password N3t4ccess
		//if crypto key... does not work, it means there is no domain-name
			//just add 'ip domain-name abc.com' //choose whatever name unless specified	
		crypto key generate rsa
			--> 1024
 
		//verify
		@R1
		conf t
		 ssh -1 netadmin 10.1.3.11 //login to 10.1.3.11 using ssh with the username netadmin
			- Password: N3t4ccess

		//save config
		@R1, R2, & R3
		copy running-config startup-config
