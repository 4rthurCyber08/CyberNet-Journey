/gi0/1-Sw2-gi0/2		-	 gi0/2-Sw3-gi0/1\

	(Default) Priority: (Sw1,Sw2, & Sw3)32768
	MAC Address: (Sw1)1111.1111.1111, (Sw2)2222.2222.2222, (Sw3)3333.3333.3333
	
	//Who is the Root Bridge?
	//What are the Root Ports?
	//What are the Designated Ports?
	//What are the Blocking (Non-Designated) Ports?
	
	Root Bridge
		//Bridge - very old ver of Switches
		The switch with the lowest Bridge ID(BID)
			//Bridge ID - Priority + MAC Address
		Therefore Sw1 with MAC Add of 1111.1111.1111 is the Root Bridge
	
	Root Port - the one(and only one) port on a non-Root Bridge that's closest to the Root Bridge, in terms of cost.
		//Cost - the cost of the route going to the root bridge. Calculation: depends. //Upon exiting or going to another switch 
			//cost of travel
			Short Path Cost Metthod
				//No Formula. Just memorize
				Port Speed	STP Port Cost
				Mbps:  	10 - 100
						100 - 19
				Gbps:	1 - 4
						10 - 2
			
			Long Path Cost Method
				Formula = 20Tbps/Port Speed
				Port Speed	STP Port Cost
				Mbps:  	10 - 2,000,000
						100 - 200,000
				Gbps:	1 - 20,000
						10 - 2,000
		
			//cost ex.	Sw2(gi0/1: 4cost) -> (gi0/1: only entering so no cost)Sw1[RootBridge] = 4 cost total
						vs
						Sw2(gi0/2: 4cost) -> (gi0/2: only entering so no cost)Sw3(gi0/1: 4cost) -> (gi0/2)Sw1[RootBridge] = 8 cost of travel
		Therefore Sw2's Root Port is gi0/1 and Sw3's Root Port is gi0/1
	
	Designated Port - the one(and only one) port on each segment that is closest to the Root Bridge in terms of cost.
		//Typically the ports on the Root Bridge
		Sw2(gi0/1: Root Port) - (gi0/1: Designated Port)Sw1(gi0/2: DP) - (gi0/1: Root Port)Sw3
		
			//But what about the segment between Sw2 - Sw3?
			the cost of both ports are the same because of gi0/1 -> Sw1.
			which means we have to look at the BID (Bridge ID) - the one with the lowest becomes the Designated Port of that segment
			Therefore Sw2(gi0/2: Designated Port)
		
	Blocking Port (Non-Designated Port) - everything that's left. (gi0/2: Non-Designated Port)Sw3
