LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)

Etherchannel - simultaniously create traffic between two links. //max 8 links
	- resulting in higher bandwidth
	- provides load-balancing
	- creates redundant links // backups
	
PAgP: Port Aggregation Protocol
LACP: Link Aggregation Control Protocol //can have additional 8 links to existing max links

VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
	//tldr. configuring a vlan on one switch will affect others.

VTP Modes
 1. Server - create/delete/modify VLANs
		-configuration revision number //sets a priority on what it will listen to
 2. Client - cannot create/delete/modify VLANs
 3. Transparent - doesn't participate VTP but can still forward advert
 4. Primary Server - only available in VTP ver 3, the only switch that can create/delete/modify VLANs
 
 //prevent problems from adding new switch
	switch to transparent mode then change config rev #
